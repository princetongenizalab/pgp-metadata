# PGP Metadata

This repository is used to version and publish data from the [Princeton Geniza Project](https://geniza.princeton.edu/) (PGP). The data files are automatically exported and synchronized from the PGP database. Commits include co-author information where possible, to credit the researchers who are working on the data.

Files in the data directory should _NOT_ be edited or modified directly.

The code that generates these exports is part of the PGP v4 codebase, available at https://github.com/Princeton-CDH/geniza

## Access via Flat GitHub

Data files can be viewed, filtered, and downloaded with Flat GitHub's Flat Viewer. Please note that it may take a moment for large files to load.
