5. Was data derived from another source? 

	Datasets are exported from the Princeton Geniza Project v4.x (PGPv4):

	Princeton Geniza Project, version 4.22.0. Center for Digital Humanities at Princeton, 2025.

	Koeser, Rebecca Sutton, Gissoo Doroudian, Ben Silverman, Nick Budak, Kevin McElwee, and Ryan Heuser. “Princeton-cdh/geniza: V4.22”. Zenodo, May 19, 2025. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15464178.

Data organizes and curates content from other sources including:
	S. D. Goitein unpublished papers
	Data from Genizah Research Lab at Cambridge University Library (2017)
	Documentary source identification from Friedberg Genizah Project
	Transcriptions and translations in footnotes dataset are drawn from scholarly sources documented in the sources dataset


DATA & FILE OVERVIEW

1. File List: 

	documents.csv : metadata describing PGP documents (letters, court case summaries, etc.). This is the primary entry point for the datasets.

	fragments.csv : metadata describing the fragments, or the material support, on which documents are written(typically paper or parchment); includes information about the holding library or museum and identifier assigned by that institution (“shelfmark”)

	sources.csv : bibliographic metadata for  secondary source scholarship about Geniza documents, particularly unpublished transcriptions and translations. Not a comprehensive list of all documentary Geniza scholarship; only includes sources cited in PGP data.

	footnotes.csv : information linking scholarly sources to specific documents, people, and places; includes plain text transcription and translation content.

	people.csv: biographical metadata describing some people mentioned in, or otherwise related to, Geniza documents. 

	places.csv: metadata describing places associated with Geniza documents (whether mentioned in the text or where they were written or sent).

	datapackage.json: specifying format and rules for the data files above, and the non-commerical license.

3. Relationship between files, if important: 

	documents.csv is intended to be the primary entry point, and can be used in combination with other files:

	fragments.csv can be joined with documents to provide information about holding institutions and access to images via IIIF; can be joined from documents.csv based on shelfmark (delimited with “ + “ for documents that are associated with multiple fragments) or by pgpids delimited list field in fragments.csv

	footnotes.csv link documents to sources; can be joined with document information based on pgpid in documents.csv and document_id in footnotes.csv

	people.csv and places.csv relate to documents but exports in the current dataset only include counts of related documents; the list of specific documents can be found at the url included in the data for entries with public urls.

4. Additional related data collected that was not included in the current data package: 
	Images of fragments are not included, but are referenceable via IIIF Presentation manifests
	PGP-specific arrangement of images for documents (overrides for fragment image order, orientation, and exclusion)
	Links between people and documents or places and documents
	Events

5. Are there multiple versions of the dataset? 
	This is the first published version of PGP data.
	

METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION

1. Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: 

	Data is based on researchers finding documentary sources from the Cairo Geniza or related caches of documents and adding them to the database with descriptions. In some cases, batches of suspected or known documentary materials were imported from other sources and then described. Other researchers read the original fragments and transcribe them (using paleographic skills as well as linguistic knowledge of Judaeo-Arabic, Hebrew, Arabic, and Aramaic). Scholars translate the documents (if we’re lucky). Research assistants help tag the documents with relevant scholarship, dates, people, and places.

For more details, refer to the history of the Princeton Geniza Lab: https://genizalab.princeton.edu/about/history-princeton-geniza-lab 

2. Methods for processing the data: 

	From 2016 until 2021, PGP document and fragment metadata were managed in a Google Sheets spreadsheet, with additional related data in a SQL database (links to Goitein scholarship) and transcription content stored as XML in a BitBucket git repository.

	In 2021, PGP data was migrated to a relational database managed by a Python/Django web application (PGPv4); data curation since that point is mediated by an admin interface to the database. 

	The datasets are generated as tabular flat-file exports of selected data from the full PGPv4 relational database.
 
3. Describe any quality-assurance procedures performed on the data: 

	Data structure and required fields are enforced and validated by the database and associated web application. Content based on scholarly interpretation has some degree of subjectiveness. The data includes notes (such as in description or notes fields) when there are differences between scholarly opinions. Research assistants are regularly improving the data, including correcting errors and adding new information.

Files in the data directory should _NOT_ be edited or modified directly.

The code that generates these exports is part of the PGP v4 codebase, available at https://github.com/Princeton-CDH/geniza

## Access via Flat GitHub

Data files can be viewed, filtered, and downloaded with Flat GitHub's Flat Viewer. Please note that it may take a moment for large files to load.
